# ChatGPT's summary: The Plutonian Pebbles change with each blink following
# specific rules: a stone marked 0 becomes 1; if a stone's number has an even
# number of digits, it splits into two stones with the left half on the left
# and the right half on the right; otherwise, a stone is replaced by one
# engraved with its number multiplied by 2024. The order of stones remains
# preserved, and your task is to determine how many stones there will be after
# blinking 25 times.
#
# My Reflection:
# After reading description: Well, seems like just more array manipulation, and
# probably easier than some of the previous days. No sweat.
