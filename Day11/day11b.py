# ChatGPT's summary:
# (I didn't include because the only difference is the blink count is now 75)
#
# My Reflection:
# After reading description: Okay, so I change blinks to 75 and wait...
# During: ...for 4 hours (34 blinks in)... (cancels and changes to storing as
# int instead of str) ...and wait...
# 
#
# There may be a faster way, possibly iterating once only but moving backwards
# after a change, so I may revisit later to try it for fun.
