# ChatGPT's summary:
# (I didn't include because the only difference is the blink count is now 75)
#
# My Reflection:
# After reading description: Okay, so I change blinks to 75 and wait...
#
# During: ...for 4 hours (34 blinks in)... (cancels and changes to storing as
# int instead of str) ...and wait...
#
# 46 minutes later: Canceled. Still too slow, but it used less memory.
#
# Rethink... Fork? Store values for lookup? Iterate once but repeat at each
# stone then pop off?
# Forking will give it a speedup, but the slowness is due to the exponential
# growth so it may not be enough. Calculating once and storing the count in
# a dictionary won't be too useful as it's unlikely we will see many repeats.
# Iterating once will just change the order, likely won't help much. I am going
# to have to do some testing.
# 
# Trying forking: Got it working with multiprocessing. Still takes forever.
# Going to let it run overnight.
# While that runs, I'm going to test store/lookup rainbow tables to test for
# repetition that can be eliminated. That will be in day11b_rainbow.py
#
# See day11b_final.py for information on the final solution.
