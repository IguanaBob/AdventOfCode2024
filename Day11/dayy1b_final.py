# ChatGPT's summary:
# (I didn't include because the only difference is the blink count is now 75)
#
# My Reflection:
# Okay, after many attempts trying to get this working I searched for ideas.
# Turns out I was on the right track when I was trying to count the number of
# stones and splits with a couple of my attempts, I just didn't have all the
# pieces to make it work. I found a great solution by Josiah Winslow here:
#   https://winslowjosiah.com/blog/2024/12/11/advent-of-code-2024-day-11/
# He also posts his solutions on github.
#   https://github.com/WinslowJosiah/adventofcode
# Unfortunatly, he doesn't list a license, and althought I did integrate it
# into some of my existing code, some parts of it are based on his blog
# post and code so I don't want to violate his copyright by posting my version.
# Please see his post and code for an excellent solution. To get an idea of
# my version, I would say I had about 80-90% of a similar sturcture, then
# fleshed it out the rest of the way using his code until it functioned.
# It was good education on Counters and other things I am less familiar with.
