# ChatGPT's summary:
# The Historians discover that many location IDs appear in both lists,
# suggesting that some numbers may have been misinterpreted. This time,
# you need to calculate a similarity score by multiplying each number from
# the left list by how many times it appears in the right list, then summing
# all these products. The final score will provide insight into how similar
# the two lists really are.
#
# My Reflection:
# Same basic logic as the Bash version, I just use basic Python math functions
# for the counting and multiplication. Nothing too interesting.
