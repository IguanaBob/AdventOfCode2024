# ChatGPT's summary:
# The Chief Historian has gone missing, and a group of
# Elvish Senior Historians is tasked with finding him by checking
# historically significant locations. They have two incomplete lists of
# location IDs, and your job is to calculate the total distance between
# these lists by pairing up the smallest numbers from each list and summing
# the differences between corresponding pairs. The total distance will help
# them reconcile the lists and find the missing historian.
# 
# My Reflection:
# Again, not hard. This was just a re-write using Python as I changed what
# language I wanted to focus on practicing.
#
# As I had wanted, on the re-write I allowed for an input file of any length.
