# ChatGPT's summary:
# The Historians discover that many location IDs appear in both lists,
# suggesting that some numbers may have been misinterpreted. This time,
# you need to calculate a similarity score by multiplying each number from
# the left list by how many times it appears in the right list, then summing
# all these products. The final score will provide insight into how similar
# the two lists really are.
#
# My Reflection:
# Not too hard. I count simply by using "grep -c" on the 2nd list for each
# number on the first list. In the Bash version I again hardcoded a 1000 limit.
