# ChatGPT's summary:
# The Chief Historian has gone missing, and a group of
# Elvish Senior Historians is tasked with finding him by checking
# historically significant locations. They have two incomplete lists of
# location IDs, and your job is to calculate the total distance between
# these lists by pairing up the smallest numbers from each list and summing
# the differences between corresponding pairs. The total distance will help
# them reconcile the lists and find the missing historian.
#
# My Reflection:
# Fairly easy using simple bash commands. Not much to say.
#
# If I was to rewrite I would not hardcode the forloop length but let it run on
# A file of any length.
#
# My initial version of this had the input file split and sorted manually ahead
# of time into seperate files. I later decided this was against the spirit and
# re-wrote it to do all processing within the script.
