# ChatGPT's summary:
# The topographic map represents elevations with a scale from 0 to 9. Hiking
# trails start at height 0, end at height 9, and increase by exactly 1 at each
# step. The task is to find all trailheads, which are positions with height 0,
# and calculate the score for each trailhead. A trailhead's score is the number
# of reachable 9-height positions via a hiking trail. The goal is to sum the
# scores of all trailheads on the map.
#
# My Reflection:
# OH YEAH, recursion for real this time!!! Seemed like the most logical way
# to traverse multiple paths. In testing I found that there would be multiple
# paths that would lead to the same 9 height location, so I had to keep track
# of visited locations so as to not count multiple equivilent paths. Hardest
# part was keeping track of the score variable's initialization through
# multiple layers of recursion.
