# AdventOfCode2024
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2024

I will post them as I go. I started with Bash, then started over with Python a few days later.

I am releasing this AGPL 3.0. I will not be including my input files, but in theory everything should work on any input file. I am releasing it for education purposes and to showcase my solutions. Hopefully you will use it to learn, not cheat.
