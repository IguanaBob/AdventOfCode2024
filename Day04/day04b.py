# ChatGPT's summary:
# The task has shifted from finding the word "XMAS" to finding two instances
# of "MAS" arranged in the shape of an X. Each MAS can appear forwards or
# backwards, and the X shape can occur in any orientation. Your goal is to
# count how many times an "X-MAS" appears in the word search, where the two
# MAS are arranged in an X shape.
#
# My Reflection:
# Not your Grandma's wordsearch, maybe. Now we need X shaped "words", and you
# would think this would complicate the logic, but really it simplified it as
# there was less things to check even though the shape is no longer a line so
# there is only one check loop instead of multiple.
