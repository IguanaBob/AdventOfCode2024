# ChatGPT's summary:
# In the Ceres monitoring station, you help an Elf with a word search to
# find all instances of the word "XMAS". The word can appear in any direction:
# horizontal, vertical, diagonal, forwards, backwards, or even overlapping.
# Your task is to count how many times "XMAS" appears in the word search.
#
# My Reflection:
# It's a child's word search, but harder, unless you do it in code. I simply
# did a search in each direction using x/y coordinates and adding 1 or -1 to
# the start position, then moved to the next postion. Not the most efficient,
# but it was easy to get working.
