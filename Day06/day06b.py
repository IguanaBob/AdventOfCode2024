# Reflection:
# This gave a good challenge over part 1. I stored every guard step including
# direction in a list to compare against for detecting looped paths.
#
# The function print_map will show the current map including with color coding.
# If this is printed every step it gives a nice animation for vizualizing the
# guard's path. I used this to ensure my movement logic worked as expected.
#
# If I was to redo this from scratch rather than base it on part-1 I would probably 
# have it just check entire rows/columns for obstructions each time it turns rather
# than test each step one by one to speed it up.
# This version takes several minutes to run.
