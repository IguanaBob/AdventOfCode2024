# ChatGPT's summary:
# The Historians travel back to 1518 to a lab with a guard patrolling the area.
# The guard follows a strict protocol: if there's an obstacle in front, they
# turn right; otherwise, they move forward. Your task is to predict the guard's
# path and count how many distinct positions the guard will visit before leaving
# the mapped area.
#
# My Reflection:
# Part 1 was not particularly hard. Was good pracitce on matrices/nested lists.
