# ChatGPT's summary:
# The engineers need help determining which calibration equations can produce
# the given test values by inserting add (+) and multiply (*) operators between
# the numbers. The operators are evaluated left-to-right, and the numbers
# cannot be rearranged. Your task is to find the equations that could possibly
# be true and sum their test values to get the total calibration result.
#
# My Reflection:
# The hardest part of this day was figuring out how to generate a list of every
# combonation of the two operators. I wanted to write my own method rather than
# just look one up, and I ended up couting up an int, converting it to binary
# then replacing 0 or 1 with the operators. This took much trial and error to
# the point that I was commenting and uncommenting temporary output so many
# times that I altered my lazy level (up? down?) by using a debug boolean to
# suppress the output. Given a re-write I probably would use a command line 
# to control this rather than changing the variable in source.
#
# I knew this had to have been solved already somewhere in a python library
# that I hadn't learned yet, and I also wanted to see an AI solution, so after
# completing my version and getting the correct answer I asked ChatGPT to
# analyze my code and give an alternative solution. It did so quite well and
# suggested using product() in place of my binary conversion, which looked
# much clearner. I thus used this function in my part 2 code.
