# ChatGPT's summary:
# The engineers discover a third operator, the concatenation operator (||), 
# which combines the digits from its left and right inputs into a single 
# number. All operators, including +, *, and ||, are evaluated left-to-right. 
# Your task is to find all the equations that can be made true using these 
# operators, then sum the test values from the valid equations to determine 
# the new total calibration result.
#
# My Reflection:
# Using product() from itertools cleaned up my operator list generation quite a
# bit. The hard part with part 2, though, was figuring out the logic to make
# the concatenate operator work. Initially I miss-understood how it was
# supposed to function, thinking it would calculate the right side of the
# operator before concatinating, and I wrote a complicated recursive function
# to make this work. After many attempts and failures to get the correct answer
# on yet another re-read of the instructions I realized I was misinterpreting
# the explanation of how this operator worked and it was to be handled
# left-to-right just like the others. I then ripped out the recursive function
# and wrote it properly. Much simpler, but practicing recurstion is something
# I needed anyway, so I still got something out of it. Always look on the
# bright side.
