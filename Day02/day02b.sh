# ChatGPT's summary:
# The engineers introduce the Problem Dampener, which allows the reactor
# safety systems to tolerate a single bad level in a report. Now, the same
# rules apply, but if removing one level from an unsafe report makes it
# safe, the report counts as safe. Your task is to determine how many reports
# are now safe, considering this new tolerance for a single bad level.
#
# My Reflection:
# The dampening logic took a long time to get working, and it's ugly how I did
# it in bash.
