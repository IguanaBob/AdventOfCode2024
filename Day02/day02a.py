# ChatGPT's summary:
# The Red-Nosed Reindeer nuclear fusion plant needs help analyzing data 
# from reports that contain lists of numbers, called levels. A report is 
# considered safe if the levels are either all increasing or all decreasing, 
# and any two adjacent levels differ by at least 1 and at most 3. Your task 
# is to determine how many reports are safe based on these rules.
#
# My Reflection:
# The logic is similar to the original Bash version, but at least the file
# reading function is improved. It also moves the checking to it's own function
# rather than a loop inside main.
