# ChatGPT's summary:
# The map contains antennas with various frequencies, and antinodes occur
# at specific locations where two antennas of the same frequency are aligned
# such that one antenna is twice as far away as the other. For each pair of
# antennas with the same frequency, antinodes are created at two locations,
# one on either side of them. Your task is to calculate the number of unique
# locations on the map that contain an antinode.
#
# My Reflection:
# This used some of the same logic for building and workign with a map that
# Day 06 and others used, so it wasn't too hard. The search functionality
# remind me of the XMAS word search as well. Easy enough.
# 
# Some of the functions around creating and displaying maps is not really
# needed, but it made testing and visualizing the logic easier for me.
