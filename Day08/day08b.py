# ChatGPT's summary:
# After accounting for resonant harmonics, antinodes now occur at any grid 
# position aligned with at least two antennas of the same frequency, including 
# the positions of the antennas themselves (unless it's the only antenna of 
# that frequency). Your task is to calculate the total number of unique 
# locations containing an antinode on the map based on this updated model.
#
# My Reflection:
# Extending part 1 presented a challenge as for some reason I had trouble
# getting the logic around calculating far antinodes working correctly.
# Not much to say for a solution other than it took a bit of brute-force
# hacking at it for a while to find the flaws in the logic.
