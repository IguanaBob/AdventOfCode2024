# ChatGPT's summary:
# The North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop's computer has corrupted memory with
# mixed valid and invalid instructions. The goal is to identify and sum the
# results of valid multiplication instructions (mul(X,Y)), ignoring any
# invalid characters or malformed instructions. Your task is to scan the
# corrupted memory, extract valid mul instructions, and calculate the total
# sum of the multiplications.
#
# My Reflection:
# On the Python re-write I went the traditional coding route, which was much
# simpler. Store the multiplcation commands in a list, split it, then multiply
# and add together. Easy enough.
