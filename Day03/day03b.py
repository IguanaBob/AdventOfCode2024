# ChatGPT's summary:
# The corrupted memory already contained do() and don't() instructions, which
# enable or disable mul instructions, but they were previously ignored. Now,
# you need to consider these instructions, where only the most recent do() or
# don't() instruction applies. Initially, mul instructions are enabled. Your
# task is to sum the results of the enabled multiplications after applying
# the correct enable/disable logic.
#
# My Reflection:
# Only addition over part 1 is find do() and don't() commands and use them to
# set variable to 0 or 1 which causes mul() commands to be skipped if 1. I
# should have used a boolean here.
